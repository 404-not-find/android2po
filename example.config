# This is an example configuration file for android2po,
# explaining the various options in more detail.
#
# Remove the comments for those options that you want
# to use.
#
# You probably want to copy this file as ".android2po"
# into the directory containing your "AndroidManifest.xml"
# file, so it'll be picked up automatically.
#


# If you don't like the default location, you can
# specify where the .po files should be stored. This
# path is relative to the path of this configuration
# file.
#--gettext locale/


# You can specify multiple message ids that should be
# ignored. Those will not be included when generating
# the .po file. As you can see, you may use regular
# expressions if you surround the expression using
# forward slashes.
#--ignore app_name color_names
#--ignore /^pref/
#--ignore /^error_level_[0-9]*$/

# This will cause messages that are marked as "fuzzy"
# in .po files to be ignored on import.
#--ignore-fuzzy


# This will ignore all strings for a language if it's .po
# file does not have the given minimum percentage of
# translated strings. This is useful if you don't want to
# ship your app with an incomplete translation, resulting
# in a mix of localized and English texts.
# Set this to 1 if you want to include only a complete
# translation.
#
# If you export into multiple .po files per language,
# they will be counted as a collective for the purposes of
# this option.
#
# If --ignore-fuzzy is also set, then fuzzy strings will
# not be counted towards to total.
#--require-min-complete 0.9


# Customize the name of the .pot template file (basically
# a .po file without any translations).
#--template template.pot

# If you don't need the .pot template file, you can tell
# a2po not to generate it at all.
#--no-template
