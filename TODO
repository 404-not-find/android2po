Support "values-en-rUS-finger"-style resource directories.

Add support for --verbosity, --quiet options.

Support an option file to configure stuff like for example .po width.

Support string-arrays. We can do this simply by writing them out using
as a context "name:item-index".

More explicitly handle empty strings, like print a warning that they
will not be included on export; on import, we might want to include
them.
